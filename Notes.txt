sounds not lights, email and sms notifs, for data organization

Modes: Experiement run, EtOH wash, regular wash

Sampling 100 ml min
sample 1 is 0 - 125 mL beep when done, runs continuously afterwards
Sample 2 beeps to place jar, then 500 - 625 mL, beep when done.
Small pause after challenge water, waits until 1 L has been passed and all floats are down, starts pure water
End of that, moves funnels out of the way, purges lines with air, and flows wash water down and purges with air aft
erwards.

Have master arduino control experiement setup adn data management, have aux arduino control pumps and floats and weight management of
efluent.
